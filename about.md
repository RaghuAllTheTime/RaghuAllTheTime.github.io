I'm Raghu. I go by the moniker of `razetime` on most places in the internet. 

I'm a computer science student, and I like to program for fun. Array programming is my forte, but I like to program in Ruby otherwise. 

I have experience with many languages and [esolangs](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Razetime) (especially [golfing languages](https://github.com/razetime/code-golf/blob/master/golflang-list.md)), but that list is very long. Occasionally I write about esolangs on [The Esolangery (Quora)](https://esolangery.quora.com/)

I like writing learning materials and documentation for things I learn. Occasionally, I make [informative videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPrZs9ZK3dqMad_cMELK24Q).

I've currently decided that I like language development and compilers. I like to help around with open source communities revolving around languages.

I like watching movies and writing about them. You can see my reviews on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/razetime).
