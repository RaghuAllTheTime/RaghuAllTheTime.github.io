I'm a computer science student, and I like to program for fun. Array programming
is my forte, but I like to program in Ruby otherwise.

I like writing learning materials and documentation for things I learn.
Occasionally, I make informative videos.

I generally work on the side of language development. Most of my open source
work is useless, and on [GitHub](https://github.com/razetime).
