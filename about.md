I'm a computer science student, and I like to program for fun. Array programming
is my forte, but I like to program in Ruby otherwise.

At a point I was exploring many languages. Occasionally I write about some
obscure ones on [The Esolangery (Quora)](https://esolangery.quora.com/). Sadly,
I rarely visit Quora nowadays as I think the website is a lost cause.

I like writing learning materials and documentation for things I learn.
Occasionally, I make informative videos.

I've currently decided that I like language development and compilers. I like to
help around with open source communities revolving around languages, and system
software. I have taken a liking to nix recently.
