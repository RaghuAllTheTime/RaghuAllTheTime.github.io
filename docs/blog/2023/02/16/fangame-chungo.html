    <br><h2>Fangames and Chungo's Gauntlet</h2><p>Despite my liking for watching fangames, I had always been afraid of playing them.</p>

<p>I used to have a save somewhere in the middle of <a href="https://kayin.itch.io/iwbtg">I Wanna Be The Guy</a> (IWBTG) many years ago, and I never considered 
touching a fangame ever since.
I Wanna Be The Guy used to be one of the few games that used to run on my old XP machine without any complaints. Alongside Osu,
Super Hexagon, and several flash games on Kongregate, that used to be one of the few games I tried to complete. Needless to say,
I failed at that.</p>

<p>IWBTG doesn’t hold your hand, it is troll-heavy, and it is very, very difficult. Many other games have been made
in its style now, plainly called “fangames”, some of which have gained popularity in streaming: <a href="https://www.delicious-fruit.com/ratings/game_details.php?id=11890">I Wanna Be the Boshy</a> is one that
brought me into looking at fangame speedruns (largely from witwix and BBF), and one day I happened upon I wanna Kill the Kamilia 2 (K2) on BBF’s
stream. Kamilia 2 is a game most people shouldn’t end up playing in their lives (and so is Boshy to some extent), but it is
much more effective in showcasing the sheer range of fangames available. K2 is a “medley” fangame, which strings together content from hundreds
of fangames into one single behemoth of shifting difficulties and genres. I am not kidding when I say that K2 has a
<em>minesweeper</em> level hidden in it. From watching any popular fangames most would conclude that they are too difficult to even
start with. Even Kamilia tends to point toward the more difficult ones among the bunch.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2023, I came upon a realization in another BBF stream that there may be nicer introductions to the genre. There
were some kind souls who pointed at <a href="https://cwpat.me/beginner-fangames/">cwpat’s beginner fangames list</a>, and I instantly knew
I was going to play chungo’s gauntlet.</p>

<p>Many fangames mimic the style of the classic IWBTG:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the original kid, his shooting and double jump physics</li>
  <li>Borrowing assets and sounds from several video games and using them for theming</li>
  <li>Troll platforms and unexpected deaths</li>
</ul>

<p>In general it seems like IWBTG was a space for a younger Kayin to create a fun, twisted game  while paying homage to his own
inspirations. He even shows a great understanding of why intellectual property is nonsense, and the technicalities of how his
game borrows from other franchises and I think that has carried his ideas a long way. There are now thousands of fangames
available, and an excellent level creator in <a href="https://www.iwannamakergame.com/">I Wanna Maker</a>, making it very easy to
start creating platformers and see people play them. Chungo’s gauntlet however isn’t exactly in the same vein.</p>

<p>Even though it is well known as a fangame, Jane_Chef’s game Chungo’s Gauntlet is still very much it’s own thing. The physics, main character and
the platforming style is a big departure from the other games on cwpat’s list, and it even has the pluck to add natural difficulty
progrssion into the platforming. You only get a double jump around 3/4ths (?) in to the game, and most of the time you don’t
require the gun. Chungo’s Gauntlet despite being a massive meme, is also an excellent place to see how Jane has improved her 
game making skill from her previous games (see: <a href="https://jane-chef.itch.io/chungo-kong-2">Chungo Kong 2</a>). It completely manages
 to shrug off the feeling that the game is made from scraps of
other games, seamlessly blending its own artwork into the fabric of the games it’s inspired from. Even the troll sections
become increasingly more readable, it’s just so smart to make even that masterable in some sense. The player is trained to read
background sprites and guess the effect of a troll before they land on it. Maybe the only genuinely unfair part of this game is
the bullet hell bosses, which do occasionally come up with impossible patterns.</p>

<p>My favourite parts of this game among the many beautiful stages was the LISA the painful stage (hehe Lois I’m a JOY MUTANT),
the one where you play Simon Says with the rock, and the ticking time bomb. Even in the sheer variety of platforming challenges
available, it doesn’t compromise on creativity or its sense of balance. Even among the other games I’ve been playing lately, it
felt incredibly fulfilling.</p>
