    <br><h2>Keyboard Controls</h2><p>Keyboard controls vastly vary with every video game, but they often have the same homogeneous interfaces that let the user customize
them.</p>

<p>I find it to be a pain that games from 2000 and 2023 both sport basically the same design for these interfaces as well.</p>

<p>One difference is that Deus Ex lets you set more than one key/mouse button to a control, which is pretty useful in a first
person game. The problem then, is that it’s very hard to find out what a button actually does in the game. A search
tool is a simple idea that makes this much easier. Just press a button and the game will locate the action it does for you.</p>

<p>Another problem I encountered was when I accidentally bound left click to the wrong action, resulting in an
hour of pain trying to figure out what the hell went wrong. There was no useful way to find out what it was originally bound to
other than a reset, but I had already customized it to a point where a reset would mean even more work. That brings me to my
next gripe. When a keyboard control is changed, you should show what it was previously bound to.</p>

<p>What can make the experience even worse is if the menu for setting controls <em>uses</em> the controls that you are setting. This is
notable in Guilty Gear Accent Core +R (Steam version), where changing ‘up’ to a different key means you have to awkwardly use the
menu with the new control. Them’s Fighting Herds, a newer fighting game also forgets about this. When the user is setting new
controls, the controls for the menu should not change. Guilty Gear Strive only half fixes this by having another menu for setting
the controls for using menus in the game. One way i can think of, is that once new controls are set, it updates all at once when
you exit the menu.</p>

<p>Finally, when I do set controls I want to try them out. Give me a chance to check my buttons immediately. Accent Core +R luckily
does solve this somewhat by letting players change controls in practice mode, but it’s still a hidden quality of life feature.
Please make it obvious.</p>
