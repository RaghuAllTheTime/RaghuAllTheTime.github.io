    <br><h2>Dice Games</h2><p>A certain video game has gotten me into dice-based board games again, and I came to wonder why I stopped playing them as much.</p>

<p>I play chess and go semi-regularly, but those games have determined, well-defined strategies to win. To some degree they are fair,
and they provide many ways for any player to equalize. Chess and Go are very painful to lose at, in a sense that any of the many
mistakes you can make are entirely your fault, and that hurts a lot more than other games, and it makes the game feel a lot less
casual. So, it’s no surprise that I’ve been playing games with a ton of RNG recently. Spelunky 2 is almost equally as
demoralizing as chess, somehow both of these games keep finding brand new ways to kill you. I’ve reached Tiamat several times
and failed, and sometimes it feels like finding a way to win may be neverending.</p>

<p>Which brings us to dice games. I’d never been a huge fan of RNG in the past, and so do many impressionable children when they
play Snakes and Ladders as their first dice game. It has little sugarcoating above plain old dice rolls, and it is moderately
funny to see people in the lead get wrecked by a long snake. Snakes and Ladders makes every loss feel undeserved, and every win
feels undeserved. The only gratification we get is laughing at other people’s despair as they descend downwards. Other well-known
dice games like Ludo add <em>some</em> strategy to the mix, letting the player choose a unit to move, and choose whether they want to
introduce units into the game. But, that is the most control you get over the game. It feels unsatisfying to play these games
because they don’t require you to think much. It’s much better as a reason to sit around a table and talk to people.</p>

<p>So then we come to <em>Business</em>. Which, outside India, is called Monopoly. Business has a lot more interesting ideas and systems
in place, particularly a resource (money) that can be used, gained and stolen. Business is a high-setup, high-skill game, but it
gives all players random chances to lose as much as they can win. The complication of Business, together with calculation or
reckless risk-taking feels incredible to play when you do get rewarded, almost unlike any other board game. the problem with
Business is that tracking player properties and planning strategy is overwhelming, and it has to be done for a high number of
rounds. I have never seen a Business game of more than four players complete in my life. It seems that much better longtime
players can manage it though, and it comes around to 45 minutes a session, shorter if the players are good. A serious problem
with Monopoly though, is that it doesn’t keep players on the board. Once you are bankrupt, you are dead. As turns go on, moving
a lot becomes vastly worse. It doesn’t allow comebacks and it rewards very miserly, slow play once the initial rounds are over.
Even though not a hallmark of design, it does provide a lot of useful ideas.</p>

<p>A non-RNG game that uses players themselves as RNG is Scotland Yard, a game that uses cards to build much better
confusion. Few things compare to playing Mr. X in Scotland Yard, and the game lasts just long enough to avoid
being a chore. The twisty and well-placed routes of Scotland Yard make the cat-and-mouse chase of it all a lot more gratifying,
as it integrates detective work into a much better, layered movement system that rewards a correct prediction with a nicer
chance at getting the catch. There is a dice game version but it id of doubt that it preserves the speed of this game.</p>

<p>So, after going through several fighting game crises, I found that I still had an old copy of 100% Orange Juice (OJ) lying in my
Steam library, from the time it was released for free. It has clear Mario Party Influences, revolving around gaining and losing
stars, but it also combines ideas from several of the aforementioned games, including ability cards, stats, a simple battling
system, default enemies, bosses, and characters with varying stats. OJ does things with a board game that only a computer could, because even though playing the game in real life is humanly somewhat feasible, it is much nicer to have the computer
fairly and correctly organize your resources in a second, as opposed to taking a few minutes. This complexity never gets in the
way of OJ’s success, as it clearly delineates beginner characters and comes with simple story-oriented games for learning its
basics.</p>

<p>But really why OJ is so addicting is that somehow it manages to keep the chaos unfair for everyone. Every character’s design
feels so purposeful as you play more games with them, and it genuinely feels rewarding to pull off risky business, or just use a
character’s base mechanic. Lone Rider is a famous example of this, who has a hyper card that gives him the ability to zoom
across the board. He has to lose his speed in order to level up, making him a strong opportunist that has to pick his speed-up
times very wisely. OJ takes a lot of liberties being a computer game, adding in visual and animated flourishes that keep
everything so fresh even when there is little happening on the board. And if the past two weeks have been indicative of anything,
I definitely will be playing it for a long time.</p>
