Spoilers for the entire game. be warned.

Transistor is set in this sort of hyperfuturistic tech utopia, where realistic imbalance and the base humanity of people seems
to be intact. The most notable thing you can see immediately is that you can harvest abilities from people and use them as your
own. I initially thought of this power as a device to raise moral questions about how work is treated in current capitalist
societies, and how this weapon could function as a brutal metaphor for it. The use of this weapon however, is simple: throughout
the story it is heralded as an inimitable, all-powerful weapon that is an excuse for our singer protagonist to endure an
onslaught of robots. It is a special superuser key, a be-all-end-all object that somehow with its existence makes the story
boring.

Supergiant never goes far with the ideas that the transistor very directly provides with its design, instead going for a
different approach. There are a few reactionary thinkers 
(probably named after the [Florentine Camerata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Camerata))
who instead of attempting to draw an audience to their ideas take
anti-social shortcuts. In the process they find the transistor, which lets them steal the abilities of several gifted people in
order to impose their will on the city. The idea is to completely reset the city, which I am guessing is Los Angeles But What If
It Was Good. The go on a killing spree with the transistor, and naturall mess up their plans when they get to Red, who is saved
by her unnamed lover. This messes with the algorithm and effectively makes the "process", the Camerata's cultural reset tool go
berserk and start outright destroying stuff. In some ways the powers that celebrities have in the Transistor ingame universe
are supernatural. Red's singing for example, caused nondescript amounts of insanity in her crowds, the implication being that
killing her with the transistor would provide crowd control abilities, allowing them to effectively convince the people of
Cloudbank that this was a good idea. This didn't happen, and the gameplay starts at that point of the story.

Now, alongside this story is a romance narrative that is very unconvincing, but even outside of that, all the piles of lore that
this game accumulates ends up being largely unconvincing, as it rarely ever uses these lore bits for any commentary. Red never
undergoes much development and she's never made to question what she does. The transistor is meant to be the main speaking
protagonist and he is nothing but annoying after the tutorial sections. Even though the transistor contains her fiancee now,
I see no connection, no charm, no love in their relationship. The artistic choices here baffle me, cause they do expect you to
buy the connection between red and her lover, who is now a USB greatsword. The ending has some logic to it, in that the
transistor needed to be given to the process. But, in some ways it also makes sense that adding Red to the transistor would
immediately halt the process as that was the reason it malfunctioned in the first place. The ending here is also baffling in that respect, since she cared enough to preserve herself in the "real" world, fighting stuff she had no experience with, and still ended up killing
herself to have a chance at seeing a neutered virtual version of her lover. Basically everything about the story ends up being a
massive disappointment, even though it is an interesting experiment.

The gameplay is a combination of hack-and-slash, puzzle mechanics, and turn based games. The enemies, however, are pretty
ordinary, and they don't always counter the player's improvement so much as they outright attempt to nullify whatever useful
abilities you have. This means they have perfect aim, perfect tracking, healing stations, quick recovery. And later in the game
they get to obscure your vision, they get stealth, nuke shells, and they are even more slippery. The player character does not
have enough health to survive that stuff, and this is where we get to Turn():  the time stop mechanic. What this effectively
lets you do outside of real time attack (and defense, which is simply running behind walls and/or dashing) is plan attacks to
obliterate many robots in one fell swoop. Even though the abilities have been seen in many RPGs, the intentionality of every
aspect of their design shows up here. You'll have to predict timing for each attack, see things the predictive system of turn
doesn't see, and combine effects from multiple abilities with your positioning to make things work correctly. Robots respawn
at *full health* if you don't collect their fallen parts (called 'cells'), so you have to plan getting those along with
attacking.

Transistor avoids satisfying offense in order to emphasize the turn mechanic. In the process it makes ordinary offense painful
and rarely ever worth it outside of the time stop. Assuming perfect play, it would be adequate to simply spam turn and hide.
However, the usual problem after smacking a robot with Turn() is that you have to run for a few seconds as overpowered robots
with twice your walk speed run you over. The dash attack is useful sometimes but even with its combinations it is woefully
inadequate. You still rarely ever have to reconsider your strategy for most waves, as you have four lives to deal with the
robots in every single save. There is a catch though. Supergiant games for some reason decided to neuter your game by *removing*
a single ability every single time you die, making the game more unbearable to play with every life. They could just kill me and
ask me to change my strategy instead, cause not everything needs to be unique.

The place where I think transistor succeds best is in its practice rooms and challenges (backdoor). The curated, well documented areas of
the game are much better suited to the game's mechanics, and they teach you an understanding of the game much better than any of
the areas in the main storyline. It's a shame that these are only sparsely accessible and unlock based on level, because they
are simply marvelous to finish (and exist as some of the only truly difficult areas in the game). These parts are so well
designed because they teach you how the puzzle pieces lock together, how your build can do crazy damage by limitng your options
and number of turns. Maybe in a future title, these ideas will have a better home, anda better story to go with them. The
beautiful isometric vistas could use some life to them. Drawing and experimentation alone did not end up at good art, but it
might help them create something truly impressive in the future.
