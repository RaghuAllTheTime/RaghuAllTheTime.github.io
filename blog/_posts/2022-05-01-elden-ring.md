Elden Ring has been a big topic on social media for a while now, and many have spoken about it after having spent countless hours discovering its secrets.
I am going to talk about it with no in-game experience.

A fun part of the internet is that you can experience so many different forms of art without having to pay for them. It's quite awesome that you can
understand the intricacies of these dark, sorrowful worlds of broken dreams without having to explore them. Creators like VaatiVidya manage to 
recreate these atmospheric, heartbreaking storylines narrated through fights and item drops into more continuous storylines.

Elden Ring brought me into the soulsborne universe by simply being everywhere, and through its awesome music. It seems to have given many artists an 
inspiration to make macky things within its framework. There's so much room for creativity within the confines of Elden Ring that it was a mind
exploding experience to realize that there are even more games to look forward to and experience.

The teams behind Dark Souls and its successors have made some truly incredible pieces of game art by following their original formula and refining it in
ways that are so subtle and impressive. I can see very careful modifications that come from the success and failure of every iteration of Dark Souls,
each one making something even more impressive. Bloodborne has an incredible combination of all these hallmarks from every iteration, and I can 
endlessly watch people describe how excellently it is composed.

I recently started Sekiro, and I've been having a lot of fun. This series makes me so happy. Its music, characters and singular commitment
to being the way it is reminds me that I want to make art too.
