A few tips if you're joining SRM VDP.

- SRM VDP is a depressing place. If you have the ability to choose, choose a bigger campus. Or a 
  different college.
- Many people prefer to ditch the hostel for a different accomodation. I do know the food is not good
  in the hostel, among other things.
- SRM has full college WiFi and you can get it for all your devices at the ERP area of the college.
  It is often spotty, but it's usually faster than mobile data.
- The lab is open all day, and if there's no class in it, you can just walk into a lab and use
  the systems there. The first lab on the first floor is the only good one.
- All students have a lab username in SRM. Your username is your roll no. and your password is 
  "student", usually. You can have private sessions and store things on SRM's resources in 
  these accounts.
- Laptops are allowed in class and some teachers do not care as long as you say you are taking notes.
- Be nice to your lecturers. They are also overworked, and they need some cooperation. The nicer you
  are to your lecturers, the nicer they will be on your exams. This also applies to research
  opportunities and other useful things.
- Get every single teacher's phone number ASAP, every single semester. You need all of them.
- Once you have the numbers you can ask quick doubts over phone. Most teachers are more than willing 
  to explain their subject over and over.
- Get your records done quickly. They're always due right before CT-3/Finals, and you don't want to 
  waste hours waiting for stamping and signatures when you should be studying.
- Pester your teachers for question banks, and make sure they are medium-sized or small. 
- Printing facilities are available at SRM. You can go to the finance dept (ground floor in my time)
  and get a ticket for how many ever pages you need.
- SAP is a colossal pain from what my fellow classmates have told me. A lot of work is spent in 
  achieving course parity, and SRM does not assist in many matters. However, a foreign university
  is a foreign university, so it might be worth the risk.
- You can only choose either placement or a masters degree. SRM will punish you if you decline job offers.
  If you want to try both, then you'll have to plan that completely solo.
- You have the most time to do things in first year. If you haven't learned programming, that is the 
  most ideal time. Python and C are always useful in college.
- Join clubs early and get involved with their activities early. You can skip a lot of college this way,
  and get some genuinely valuable experience.
- SRM mail has shopping discounts, sometimes on movies. Your mail gets a ton of useful things, if you
  care about useful academic opportunities.
- Check out the books for an elective before you choose it. Chances are if the book is filled with 
  Greek symbols or paragraphs of corporate jargon, you do not wanna suffer with it for six months.
- Choosing the easiest subject is better for your CGPA. Do harder subjects in your spare time in online
  courses, where you can fail/do badly in safety.
- Fests are cool (Ubertech, Kratorq), but few of them provide good On-Duty attendance. Make sure you
  will have full day OD (usually after snack break) before paying for it.
- SRM VDP has bad ventilation and disproportionate cooling. The AC is still a lifesaver in Chennai, but
  I recommend getting a jacket, taking time to walk around, even outside the class to get some better
  air in any break you get.
- PD subjects (usually anything with PDM in the subject code) are *cumulative*. They also happen
  to be the most useful subject across all 4 years of college, since you will find an MCQ test in 
  every single place that has a selection process. It is best to keep a single fat book for all 4 
  years, because every single strat taught in that class means you get to make one question
  easier.
- The library has very few good books. Most of them are outdated. Always check the publishing year
  so you don't end up reading outdated stuff, since most of the library is useless. There is some fiction
  in one corner of the library.
- Sports facilities suck, but there is some sports equipment in the sport department on the third floor.
  A table tennis board is there, but you need to bring your own rackets.
- SRM puts all their effort into detecting cheating and bullying. The only thing that ranks higher than 
  that is placement. It really isn't worth cheating in SRM.
- SRM can basically place anyone, but you won't be getting anything particularly appealing with a high
  CGPA alone. Skill yourself in a popular competency early, because pure college work will get you
  barely anything.
- Prep for exams like TOEFL, GRE, GMAT and such before your third year, and finish them before your 
  fourth year. This will let you spend time on writing an application and improving your chances of
  getting a good master program.
- Previous year question papers are very useful, and sometimes SRM just recycles them for newer exams.
  Some previous year papers are available at the library, and you can also ask your seniors.
