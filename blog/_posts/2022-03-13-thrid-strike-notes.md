Since I've been learning and enjoying some Third Strike in the past few days I'm documenting some of the simpler things I have
to keep in mind while playing the game.

###### Basic tech
- tap down when you get knocked down from throws and non-super juggles. 5 frame window, even pros sometimes miss it.
- keep your arms floating above the keys, and keep them loose. inputting otherwise becomes much more restricted and it may
  damage your nerves.
- piano your supers (tap each punch/ each kick consecutively). always
- SOCD is fine. You are playing on a keyboard and it is likely you will never use a fightstick in your
  life. And even if you do, the muscle memory is entirely different. Just focus on enjoying the game.
- three punches and three kicks macros are not unusual in fighting games, so i guess i'll temporarily use it for ex moves.
- Parries are half the mind game and you should learn timing and practice them on your opponent early.
- inputting a fireball after a dragon punch move or another fireball or another half circle gives you a super motion.
  Indispensable in combos. This also means simplistic hit confirms into super are much harder to input fast.


###### Dudley
dudley is a midlly heavy whiff punish, counter hit baiting and pressuring machine. His entire kit rides on it, from his
unreactable overhead, specials which all feed into evasion and approaching, to his general combos.

Dudley does not have 

use target combos in pressure to get tons of space (even on block):
- cr.lk cr.mk cr.hk
