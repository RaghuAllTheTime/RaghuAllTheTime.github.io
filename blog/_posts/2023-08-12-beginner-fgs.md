I've been ardently watching fighting games and smash for ages, and I decided one day in September 2022 to try out the genre. After a year of playing them on and off, I still find it hard to justify continuing to play them.

My first fighting game was third strike on fightcade. Later I tried Them's Fighting Herds, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R, Undernight In-Birth cl-r, BlazBlue Centralfiction, and most recently, Skullgirls.
I've spent the most time on Third Strike and +R, so that is mostly what my opinions of are based on.

Playing fighting games is like doing exercise without any of the physical benefits of exercise. Hell, you might even get some long lasting nerve problems and injuries if you don't play them carefully.
The real time challenge of playing a fighting game will make you question your decision making, sanity, and your ability to use your controller of choice. Somehow, being a long time viewer didn't help ease me much into this experience.
Knowing more things about the game doesn't equate to being able to use that information. Being unable to use information is probably the worst, most helpless feeling that you can get in fighting games, and it turned up very early for me.
I would play several games versus a person, get tips I already knew about, and feel unable to execute much of it. It's already far above what I can currently do, and after the genuinely crushing experience of losing 20 games,
I cannot help but long to kill myself. Which brings me to my first concern:

> With fighting games, itâ€™s like you have to basically take it on faith that there is an amazing game available to you after you spend years of your life training with the Shaolin monks.

Many fighting games often fall out of favour with newer players for good reason: they don't do anything to ease that curve. You are confined to climbing a steep cliff face, and you have to hope that the next reward isn't too far away.
CPUs encourage terrible habits and tutorials suffice to simply show the mechanics. The middle, aka gauging your skill, learning "neutral game", combos, pressure, learning motion inputs and executing them in different situations.
Fighting games in short rarely show you progress, especially if you play people better than you, which is what happens 99% of the time. You might work on an idea for a few days and have it simply shot down by a person that already
knows how to counter it. Or you simply don't
get to play the game for 60 seconds and struggle to find a place where you get to do even the simplest improvement to your gameplan. In fighting games, being able to think calmly is hard. And most fighting games have a general design
that goes against this, having
moves that are generally infuriating to counter, and creative ways to disrespect the opponent. "It makes me mad" and "It makes me unable to think" are the hardest problems to work around in fighting games, and I don't know how long that
takes to get over, if people can even manage such a thing.

Execution is one thing that people complain about in these games, and I think the basics of them are easy, and the motions are genuinely necessary. But it very quickly gets difficult and that is ok. I don't like people that say that
execution simply comes over time, as if people cannot learn bad muscle memory and suffer for it later. People who have been playing the game for years often like to make short statements about how basic motion inputs are not hard,
or how playing neutral with limited execution practice is not hard, but that is simply not true. A single fireball in isolation is not a threatening motion, but how about when you want to backdash and fireball? you get a backwards DP
motion, which results in a slower special and probably will get you punished. How about out of a jump? after a jab? Each of these situtations can and will require a different adjustment and timing for the input. You have the general timings
memorized after years of practice, so please tell players that it is a hurdle that requires work to get consistent at. It's possible to miss a diagonal in a fireball even after months of play, or even a short break.

Hell, learning a new character's gameplan feels like learning a new game. It's most amplified in faster games like guilty gear and blazblue but the shock of a new gameplan stays the same.
I played Bullet, my first grappler in Blazblue and I just
fundamentally can't understand how to normally play the game with her. Coming from characters with ordinary movement it feels cool, and yet so overwhelming. You learn different kinds of patience and very different timings as a grappler.
People would say grapplers are easy and have simple gameplans, until they get zoned for 90 seconds and lose to hundreds of stray hits.

A good thing about fighting games is that choice of controller does not matter much, and usually you can play with a controller you already use, usually a keyboard. There are important differences, but every input method
has capability to be effective.
Blocking was easier when I started on keyboard, now I struggle to get down-back and other diagonal inputs on gamepad. Using gamepad is nice, but it feels like using a scalpel as compared to a knife, the keyboard. Which brings me to defense.
Defense is maybe the most non-obvious part of fighting games and "when to press" changes based on player, and is rarely a universal truth. Defense is where you are forced to remember that you are facing a real person, and that you should
have been observing them.
It's when you realize that there are meter and resources that make the opponent make different decisions, and affect your ability to defend. It's nice to know how to defend, but most fighting games make sure that there is only
so much time you can defend for, either in the form of absurd options to open up opponents or just guard break limits that lead to devastating damage.

Fighting games feel like tons of homework, especially anime fighters, where you have to learn do certain things by default to avoid going insane. You can't keep making conscious decisions every frame; you need to simplify your thought
process by knowing what you need for each character, and what you need for each game. The easiest way to do this, is a notebook. People say that you should be practicing for hours on
end, to grind your gears out until you become good with your favourite character, but it is easy to develop pain after just a single hour of playing a fighting game. The ideas of fighting game grind make no damn sense to me, even with
exercise, since it leads to aches for days. Spending more hours does not make the process feel any faster. Personally I feel that spamming moves with privileged characters is the most fun I ever get in these games, but I never feel entitled
to the small and big victories that doing such a thing gives, resulting in permanent negative feedback. It's best to tell people that improving can be a chore, and that managing expectations while learning is much harder than they think.
Also, that finger and arm exercises are very important.

Overall I still do intend to play fighting games, recently Venom in +R, Bullet in BlazBlue, Gato and Marco in Garou Mark of The Wolves. People often talk about simply choosing the character you think is neat in these games, and
they often say that execution should never stop a person from playing the character. I feel it is complete nonsense that execution barrier doesn't hinder one's appreciation of a character, especially when certain motions are genuinely
disliked by a large number of people. Love for a character design can only carry you so far when the way said character plays just doesn't work for you. I do want to stick with some cool characters, like ACPR venom, or bullet in BBCF,
but I'm not reluctant to
drop them if I can find a character that practically feels better to play. People learn at very different speeds, and it is entirely stupid to say that people overestimate the amount of time it takes to pick up a character. They know better
about themselves than you do. In +R and BBCF, the basics are so complicated that you first have to appreciate the game's underlying systems before you can enjoy playing any of the characters in the first place.
Some of the facets of +R's system are:
- high reward for accurate aggression
- a slippery and fast physics system that lets you carry momentum from movement and specials
- moderately strong defensive options tied to meter
- complex universal air movement options
- flexible but restrictive "gatling" combo system
 
BBCF provides:
- nearly endless offensive strings
- a complicated knockdown system
- a universal install super (overdrive) which also controls your burst resource
- and much more..

These games don't
do much to ease you into the characters, as much as they just show you the smallest glimpse of the ideas behind them, give you a pat on the back, and then leave. The rest you learn by getting smacked on the face by the few people
that continue to play the game in your region. And of course, online chatrooms and guidance pages.

Garou: Mark of the Wolves doesn't do anything particularly different from the above two games, but somehow it manages to make the learning experience easier with its general design. Garou's old input system is very lenient yet
responsive. Continuously playing the game will naturally give you an idea of how to defend. +R and BBCF reward you indirectly for instant block, providing you with frame advantage and meter gain, which are not as easy to capitalize on.
Garou on the other hand, is a low health, low timer game, and it simply goes all in.
If you just defend in Garou, you *get health back!* (among other things) And for when you get better, you can guard cancel to punish the opponent. What's more, just defend has a clear
visual indicator and a text indicator even if you do it unintentionally, which automatically cements it in the player's head as an important mechanic. Garou arguably is simpler in many ways, but I believe its systems come together in a
much nicer way. Garou's movement and jump system is a little hard to use, but it is snappy. Even with its fair share of old game nonsense, namely the existence
of Grant and how the other top tiers are, it rarely feels overwhelmingly unfair. Garou is the one fighting game where after a month, I didn't feel like I was hitting my head against a brick wall even against players close to my level.

If anything keeps me motivated it's that there's always good people to talk to and usually good people to play with. Finding a real life community for the games I like may make this learning process much nicer, but alas, I'm very much
out of luck. Sticking with a game is the best I can do, and I'll try my best as long as I have the energy to keep on rockin'.
