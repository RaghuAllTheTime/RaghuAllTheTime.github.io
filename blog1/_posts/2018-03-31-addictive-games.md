Yesterday, I finished Super Hexagon. **For the third time.**

It felt really good.

But, I also wondered, what makes me want to play certain games a lot?
The games that I'd played a lot in the past few years are osu!, League Of Legends, and Online chess.
All of these have only one thing in common: *They're replayable.*
The thing is that, each and every game I continually play has these characteristics. They give me an unending stream of happiness that I wouldn't get out of anything else, leading to a serious, painful addiction.
In biological terms, people call this dopamine. When your body does something that makes you happy, it gives you dopamine. Dopamine is what is secreted when you compile a program and run it wiht no errors. Dopamine is also secreted for the rather silly things thatmake you happy, like when you achieve something in a game. What this hormone does, is  plainly numb your mind. It keeps you in a satisfied state, and prevents you from thinking straight.
Video games take absolute advantage of this, and continually give you happy moments. Hence, you get dopamine, say, when you level up, and once your mind is completely numbed, you always feel like you can get better at the game, when you are just plainly staring at a screen for hours and hours doing nothing of use(Unless you're a streamer).
Eventually, I've realized that I've transitioned from things, or games that are actually rewarding, and moved on to games where there is no end. For example, osu has an eormous amount of beatmaps, most with unique songs that you can choose from and play. The entirety of beatmaps in osu is enough to play for an entire lifetime. So, even if you Full Combo a really hard map, there's always another map of similar difficulty to make you feel good about yourself. You can just keep playing and feeling good about yourself, thinking "I'm improving!".
The very problem is that the other games I've played a lot recently have had a similar effect. Super Hexagon is an awfully hard game whitch involves twitch based gameplay and quick reflexes. I initially started by barely getting to ten seconds on the hard difficulty. Then I just got 1 second higher than my previous score, and felt the most gratified I'd ever felt in my life. After about 7 hours of grinding this game, I finished the "hardestestest" level, to finish the entire game. In the process of trying to get a highscore, I mindlessly wasted time.
An hour after I finished the gam, I still wanted to play it.
An hour after I finished the game, I wasn't any more intelligent.
An hour after I finished the game, I felt I didn't accomplish anything worthwhile...
And then, a wek later, I finished the game twice, to try and fill the empty void left by the game.
I realized that I couldn't, so I moved on to the other games I mentioned.
I realized that if this cycle of getting instant happiness, instant gratification, and mindless grinding on games was never going to get me anywhere.
From all of this, I've realized that games like this will keep coming, and I couldn't possibly resist the temptation of playing them. But, what I can do is never get satisfied with whatever I achieve. After all, satisfaction is what keeps us from improving.
The key is to never get satisfied by anything that would waste your time, and to never get satisfied when you reach a goal you've set. You have to force yourself to work hard, and achieve beyond what you think you can.
Keep setting new goals. Reach a new high, and keep improving. Give yourself that dopamine ***ONLY*** when you really require it. Learn to use your mind correctly without staying in the dreary dreamy world of happiness and eternal joy, because life will never simply give that to you.
If life were full of happiness, It'd be rather boring, don't you think?
**TL;DR:** Stay smart, and game responsibly.
