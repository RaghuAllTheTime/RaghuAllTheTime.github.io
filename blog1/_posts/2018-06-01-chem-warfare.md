Chemical Warfare is simply, the use of chemicals to destroy life. It is a very powerful, devastating form of warfare, that is generally coupled with biological warfare.

Chemical Warfare can ben done with the use of chemical weapons. Chemical weapons can be classified into the following:-

 - **Defoliant:** Destroys plant leaves
 - **Ecocide:** Destroys the whole environment in an area.
 - **Harassing agent:** Causes temporary damage to all mammals it affects.
 - **Herbicide:** Kills entire plants, sometimes selectively
 - **Nerve agent:** Kills or disables mammals and humans, by destroying/impairing nervous functions
 - **Antipersonnel Agent:** Directly kill people, or drive them to near death.

Chemical warfare is highly effective. There is a high amount of research done in chemistry, and this has led to the development of very useful chemicals, and also led to the development of  equally harmful chemicals. The most well-known chemical weapons are:
 - Chlorine: Choking agent, causes asphyxiation
 - Tear gas:  Affects the eyes mainly, causes irritation to them
 - Mustard gas: there are multiple types of mustards which cause different types of painful blisters on human skin, and irritate all kinds of tissue.
 - Carbon Monoxide: Mixes with blood, prevents oxygen intake by blocking out haemoglobin.
 - Phosgene: Causes lung irritation and choking. Afftects bronchi and burns the lungs.

The first use of chemicals to purposefully claim life was in World War I, 1915, when the German military released about 168 tonnes of Chlorine gas on troops in Belgium, killing near 5000 soldiers. Sulfur mustard was one of the most major causes for deaths in World War I. From then onward, chemical weapons have evolved to become much stronger and have more lasting effect on the areas they are used in.
There are many types of chemical agents. Here are a few that are generally used in war:

##### Blister/Harassing Agent
These are mainly composed of gases that cause painful blisters or welts on the tissue they come in contact with.
 - Mustard gases
 - Arsenic agents: Phenyl dichloroarsine form large filled blisters on the skin.
 - Phosgene compounds: These are some of the most painful compounds ever made. They are made for torture, and form large weals on skin that do not disappear quickly.

##### Nerve Agent
These cause temporary/permanent damage to nerve tissue in order to confuse troops and disable them. they generally attack the main neurotransmitter in humans, acetyl choline. Sometimes these cause body failure and a painful death.
Some are Nitrogen compounds which interfere in motor nerves, and cause serious brain damage and organ failure.

##### Antipersonnel Agent
These are made specifically to harm humans. Most of the agents shown above are antipersonnel agents, and have been widely used in chemical warfare. There is not much to elaborate on this.

Chemical warfare agents are still being stockpiled in some countries, although numerous treaties have been made to prevent the production of chemical weaponry. Production recipes of these killing agents can even be found online, and their ingredients are not hard to buy online. The scariest thing is that if a world War III happens, it may be fought with deadly chemical weapons that could pollute our world and our lives forever.
