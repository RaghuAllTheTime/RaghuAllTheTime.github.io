Guacamelee is a metroidvain game that I had the pleasure of playing recently, and it has an impressive amount of game withing the short and simple story that it has to offer.
Like most metroidvanias, there is an enormous map with bajillions of secrets to find and collect, with their own matching puzzles and gimmicks. Guacamelee manages to keep increasing the hype of its continuous levels without creating too much of a difficulty spike, and I think that is the defining point of this game. Regular mode is well balancced, and doesn't feel like I'm driving through multiple speedbumps when I face a new enemy.

Each part is designed with the player having fun in mind, and it really shows in the gameplay. Guacamelee's combat, movement and pacing feel very smooth, with the exception of its controls, which can get annoyingly clunky sometimes.
Heavy emphasis is shown on melee combat. Each part of the combat system is very well made. Dodging, jumping and wall hanging are all important parts of the guacamelee experience, and they merge together well when it comes to a horde f enemies, or just one single boss. What makes it even better is the amount of freedom you have in this respect. The devs have made it so that inexperienced player can spam specials to win with not much repercussion. At the same time, you can smack skeletons into the air, pound them to the ground, combo them in the air and throw them forward into their own allies. This level of freedom makes it extremely satisfying to go into combat. Even if enemies are avoidable, it's still fun to have a scrimmage every now and then.

Overall, I loved Guacamelee, and what it had to offer. It was an excellent game, with the exception of few platforming issues and the ending.
