                <p>Star Island was probably one of the most fun books I’d read tin the recent times. It’s chock full of humour and coontains staccato bursts of silliness in the midst of a gloomy narrative filled with equally gloomy characters.</p>

<p>Generally, when you’re looking for a thriller, you’d think of a general basic skeleton that has been fed to you over and over again through multiple wirters. It’s not a bad format, just that it’s been repeated so much to you that it feel akin to the instructions on a shampoo bottle.</p>

<p>Star Island is a good departure from the  general thriller narrative, and manages to keep the reader alive using its sharp humour and despicable characters. If ound it awfully hard to like anyone, and the only person I got close to liking was a man with a weedwacker attached to his stump of an arm. Each part of the story is carefully crafted to highlight the worst in each individual, while improving the story’s momentum. The problem with this is that people seem to be one-dimensional with their motives in the case of stories like these. Single minded, and flat characterization made someparts of this book very hard to read through.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a pleasure to read most of the way, and I can say I did have fun. I’m looking forward to reading more books by this author.</p>
