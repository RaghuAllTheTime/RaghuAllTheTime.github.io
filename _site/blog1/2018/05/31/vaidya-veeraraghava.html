                <p><strong>Arulmigu Vaidhya Veeraraghava Swamy Koil.</strong></p>

<p>Vaidhya Veeraraghava Swamy <a class="blue lighten-3 tooltipped" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-tooltip="a temple.(Tamil)">Koil</a> is a temple located in Thiruvallur, a small town in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is an enormous temple, with a <a class="blue lighten-3 tooltipped" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-tooltip="a tank, or pool">Kolam</a> of it’s own.</p>

<p>I visited the temple at the beginning of this month. It is a very old structure, ove 1000 years old. This religious place is maintained by Sri Ahobila Mutt, a religious organization that holds Sri Vishnu as it’s main deity. It is well maintained, nad is one of the most important religious destinations of Thiruvallur, due to it’s significance as one of the 108 Divyadesams.</p>

<h5 id="why-do-people-visit-this-place">Why do people visit this place?</h5>

<p>The most important deity of this temple is <a class="blue lighten-3 tooltipped" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-tooltip="cure">Vaidhya</a> Veeraraghava Swamy. Hence, people come to this temple in order to recieve cures to their diseases as blessings from god. Any ailments will be cured by his heavenly self. some people give offerings to this manifestation of Perumal(Vishnu) to get his blessings and have good health. The process of giving our offerings to the gods while saying certain mantras is called <em>amsi.</em> These offerings are given back as <a class="blue lighten-3 tooltipped" data-position="top" data-delay="50" data-tooltip="blessed food">prasadam</a>.</p>

<p>The main deity, Sri Vaidhya Veeraraghava Swamy is situated at the center of the temple, like most others. The statue of Veeraraghava Swamy is about 10-12 feet long. He is in the resting state, presented along with the multi headed snake Adiseshan.Veeraraghava Swamy is resting on the snake’s body, whose heads are spread like an umbrella over the deity’s head. Veeraraghava Swamy’s idol is very well sculpted, and depicts the level of artistic skill that had been reached at the time.</p>

<p>Famous Hindu temples like this Devasthanam are generally crowded on most days when they are open. I was lucky to come on a rather calm day, and I got the privilege of seeing the perumal up close for a little while.</p>

<p>The other important deity in the temple is the Thaayar, who is the wife of Veeraraghava Swamy. Without worshipping the Thaayar, you cannot reap the benefits of your prayer to the Swamy. When you pray to Thaayar, you automatically get her blessings, and you receive the ability to redeem the health benefits that Veeraraghava Swamy bestows upon you.Once you do so, your holy medical checkup is almost over.</p>

<h5 id="the-power-of-salt-and-pepper">The power of Salt and Pepper</h5>

<p>At the temple, there is a place to deposit salt and pepper. It might seem peculiar to most, but there are stalls which sell packets of large crystal salt and peppercorns just outside of the temple. As most would know, Pepper and salt can solve most simple health issues and help with first aid. These are the basic foundations of ayurvedic medicine. Hence, when you deposit salt and pepper at the temple, you are giving Veeraraghava Swamy the tools to prepare your medication, so he can give it back to your in the form of his blessings. In this way, you also show your respect towards the god.</p>

<p>Overall, the temple is well made and maintained. It has internal air conditioning near the deity, to give relief from the hot sun outside. I’m very happy that this temple has survived the test of time, and has maintained it’s overall look very well. I really liked the temple and it’s friendly staff. It is an excellent holy abode, and a great place to visit.</p>
