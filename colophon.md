### About this site

This site is coded mostly in static HTML, built using the [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org) static site generator.

All pages, layouts and themeable items in this site are hand coded and made by me.

This website uses the [Materialize CSS framework](http://www.materializecss.com) for UI elements and responsive elements. It provides the overall material design aesthetic and feel to this site.
